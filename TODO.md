Intern

> I am writing a game based on pairs of words. some words need clarification because they are provided without any context. Also fix case to only use upper case for proper nouns. For example ` ["Spring","Summer"],` needs to change to ` ["spring (season)","summer"],` because Spring could also be interpreted as "a spring" which is a mechanical device. Provide the complete updated version.



> I am writing a game based on pairs of words that are similar. A player will see one of the words, and other players will see the other word. You can see I provided context when reading that word by itself is not clean. This example is for a US American audience.
> Do the same thing localized for a Chinese/simplified audience with 100 rows using words/phrases that will be familiar to them. Output using a valid JSON file compatible with the format above.
